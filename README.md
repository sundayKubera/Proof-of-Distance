### Proof-of-Distance
give "random name" to each "node"<br/>
check distance of "miner node name" and "block hash"<br/>
choose the smallest block<br/>

### TimeLine
1. new block "Block A" created
2. "some one" make "Request A" to became a node
3. new block "Block B" created ("Request A" is in "Block B")
4. new block "Block C" created ("Request A" is not in "Block C")
5. now "some one" became a node ("node name" = hash("Block C".header + "Block B".header + hash("Request A"))) //<-- something like this

### ToDo
1. improve chain choose algorithm(Done)
2. add distance calc to block(Done)
3. add Comment(it's too dirty)
4. rebuild whole system(it's too dirty too)
5. add code update transaction
